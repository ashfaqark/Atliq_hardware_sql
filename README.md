# SQL_project

This project involves working with a fictional database to perform various data analysis tasks using SQL queries. It includes generating reports on individual product sales for a specific customer, forecasting accuracy, top-performing markets, customers, and products based on net sales. Additionally, the project includes the implementation of stored procedures to assign badges (Gold or Silver) to markets based on total quantity sold in a specific fiscal year. Overall, the project showcases SQL skills for data manipulation and provides valuable insights for decision-making and business analysis.

This is a SQL project for an imaginary computer hardware company that operates in many countries.
